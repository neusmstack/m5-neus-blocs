# 🧠 M5Stackademy – STEAM Projects by Neus

**M5Stackademy** is an open STEAM education lab that brings mathematics to life using M5Stack devices, LEGO, and creative electronics.

This is a **living and growing repository**, where each project connects mathematical concepts with real-world applications through code, sensors, and design. It is designed to expand progressively, covering the full secondary math curriculum within an interdisciplinary STEAM framework.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

This repository gathers all STEAM projects developed with M5Stack devices and designed specifically for **secondary education (ESO)**, integrating **programming, mathematics, science, and technology**.

Its goals are to:

- Practice programming with M5Stack (Python and UiFlow 2.0)
- Create interdisciplinary projects for the classroom (math, physics, engineering, etc.)
- Facilitate reuse, modification, and extension of the projects

## 🔍 Highlighted Projects

### 🟥 LaserAngle

A goniometer that uses trigonometry to calculate heights from angles and laser-measured distances.  
The laser directly measures the hypotenuse, shifting focus to real-time angle detection and trigonometric reasoning.

### 🟨 PeanoFactory

A mechanical model of the Peano axioms to explore the foundations of natural numbers.  
It can also integrate robot behavior like line following.
